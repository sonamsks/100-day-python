### What is Programming ?

It is a type of written language that tells a computer what to do, like Python, Java, JS, C/C++, etc. Programming is the process of humans communicating with machines (computers) to make them perform specific task.

If I ask a calculator to add numbers, like 8 + 5, the machine will immediately respond with the total, which is 13.

### What is Python ?

Python is a programming lanaguage that supports object-oriented programming. It is interpreted and a high-level programming language.

### Features of Python

**<mark>Free</mark>** and open source, easy to code, easy to read, easy to debug, **opject-oriented** langauage and **<mark>GUI</mark>** programming support .

**<mark>High-level</mark>** language ( *Means - when we write programs in python, we do not remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage memory* ),

Python is **<mark>portable</mark>** language ( *Means - if we have python code for windows, and In case, run this code on other platforms such as linux or mac then do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platforms* )

Python **<mark>interpreted</mark>** language ( Means - Python code exec line by line at a time. like other lang C/C++, Java. No need to compile python code & this make it easy to debug our code.

**<mark>Frontend and Backend Development</mark>** ( It help you frontend dev work in python like JS. Backend used for this work cause of its frameworks like [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/).

**<mark>Large Standered Library</mark>** that provides a rich set of [modules and functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing.

### Who's Python Developer ?

Who known core python programming language to create software application, websites and various tools. They write code, debuging programs, collaborate with teams to develop solutions. Python developers work in fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence and automations.

**some of the must-know skills to become a Python Developer:**

`Core Python programming`

`Machine learning & artificial intelligence,`

`Debugging skills,`

`Framework( Django, Flask )`

`Deep learning.`
